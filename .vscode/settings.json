/*
HOW TO INTEGRATE FORMATING AND LINTING IN VSCODE:
- Install Prettier Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode
- Install ESlint Extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint (it requires the npm package 'eslint' to have been installed locally or goblally )
- Done
Note: Both extensions have been added as recommended in ./extensions.json
This will prompt at first time opening of the workspace/project the installation of them.

Those two extensions plus the following config for VSCode
will trigger the linting error highlightning. Both linting and format
will be picked from the specific config files, ie: eslintrc &
prettierrc
